## Welcome to the Ethics Bowl!

The Ethics Bowl is a competitive yet collaborative event in which students engage in philosophical debates on real-life ethical dilemmas. It differs from a traditional debate in that the central goal of this competition is to demonstrate the breadth and depth of thinking, rather than to overwhelm or dominate the opposing team. The SCEBC is more than teaching students how to analyze ethical cases: It is to teach them how to think and discuss these issues in a civic community, where they become fellow citizens of social responsibilities. Data shows that this event teaches and promotes ethical awareness, critical thinking, civil discourse, civic engagement, and an appreciation for multiple points of view.

### How is the Ethics Bowl different from a debate?

Teams are not required to pick opposing sides, nor is the goal to “win” the argument by knocking down the other team or its position. Teams offer support for its position but also consider the merits of their opponents' positions. Changing or modifying a position is not necessarily negative.

Is it O.K to punch a Nazi?

On January 20, 2017, Richard Spencer, a well-known member of the American “alt-right”, was punched in the face by an unknown assailant while he was being interviewed by an Australian journalist. The attack, which was captured on video, was almost certainly a reaction to Spencer’s vocal form of white nationalism, which includes his public support for the establishment of the U.S. as a white ethnostate. Footage of the attack soon became a popular internet meme, accompanied by the question, “Is it O.K. to punch a Nazi?” with some people comparing the masked assailant to Captain America and Indiana Jones.The punch, and the internet memes that followed it, have spawned vigorous debates about how people should respond to increasingly frequent, public displays of racism. Critics of the assault argue that violence is not the right response to political disagreement...
